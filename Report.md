# DSCP Final Project: Taiwan Air Quality Analysis Report

**Author**: Stan The Man  
**Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Course**: Data Science and Computer Programming (DSCP)

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes real-time air quality data from Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration, focusing on PM2.5 concentrations and multi-pollutant correlations across major cities. The analysis reveals significant geographical patterns and provides actionable insights for air quality improvement.

## Project Objectives

The project aimed to:
1. Analyze PM2.5 concentration patterns across Taiwan's major cities
2. Investigate correlations between different air pollutants
3. Examine geographical and meteorological influences on air quality
4. Identify areas requiring immediate intervention

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **API**: Government Open Data Platform (data.moenv.gov.tw)
- **Records**: 86 monitoring stations
- **Variables**: 24 parameters including PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and meteorological data

### Analysis Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values using group-wise imputation
2. **Geographical Analysis**: Categorized regions by latitude (North/Central/South)
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated correlations and summary statistics
4. **Visualization**: Created multiple charts for pattern identification

## Key Findings

### 1. City-Level Analysis
- **Best Air Quality**: Eastern coastal cities (Average PM2.5: ~15 μg/m³)
- **Worst Air Quality**: Industrial cities in central Taiwan (Average PM2.5: >35 μg/m³)
- **Compliance Rate**: Only 23.5% of measurements meet WHO "Good" standards

### 2. Pollutant Correlations
- **Strong Positive**: PM2.5 and PM10 (r = 0.89) - indicating common sources
- **Negative**: O3 and NO2 (r = -0.42) - photochemical relationship
- **Moderate**: SO2 and industrial pollutants - suggesting point sources

### 3. Geographical Patterns
- Northern regions show 20% lower PM2.5 than central regions
- Coastal areas benefit from ocean winds
- Mountain-adjacent stations show trapped pollution effects

### 4. Wind Direction Impact
- Northerly winds: Lowest PM2.5 (avg: 22.3 μg/m³)
- Westerly winds: Highest PM2.5 (avg: 31.7 μg/m³)
- 42% variation in pollution levels based on wind direction

### 5. Monitoring Network
- Uneven distribution (CV: 68.2%)
- Urban areas over-represented
- Rural and mountainous regions under-monitored

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Implement stricter emission controls in central industrial zones
   - Issue health advisories when westerly winds are forecast

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Expand monitoring network in underserved counties
   - Install real-time public displays in high-pollution areas

3. **Policy Measures**
   - Incentivize electric vehicle adoption in high-PM2.5 cities
   - Strengthen industrial emission standards

4. **Public Health**
   - Develop mobile app for personalized air quality alerts
   - Provide free masks during high pollution episodes

## Technical Implementation

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated API calls → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization
- **Reproducibility**: All code available on GitHub with clear documentation

## Conclusions

This analysis demonstrates that Taiwan's air quality challenges are not uniform but show distinct geographical and meteorological patterns. The strong correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 suggests that addressing particulate matter sources comprehensively would be most effective. The influence of wind patterns indicates that regional cooperation is essential for air quality improvement.

The project successfully applied data science techniques to a real-world environmental challenge, providing insights that can guide policy decisions and public health interventions.

## Future Work

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Incorporate historical data to identify trends
2. **Machine Learning**: Develop predictive models for 24-hour forecasting
3. **Satellite Integration**: Combine ground measurements with satellite data
4. **Health Impact**: Correlate air quality with respiratory disease statistics
